# Random-passoword-generator
## Description-
In this program, we define the desired length of the password and the characters that can be used to generate it. We then use the SecureRandom class to generate random indices within the range of the character string and append the corresponding characters to a StringBuilder object to form the password. Finally, the program prints the randomly generated password to the console.
## Explanation-
  -Imports: Necessary classes for password generation and secure random number handling are imported.

  -Main Class and Method: The main class RandomPasswordGenerator with the main method as the entry point is defined.

  -Password Length and Character Set: The desired password length and character set are specified.

  -SecureRandom Initialization: A SecureRandom instance is created for secure random number generation.

  -StringBuilder Initialization: A StringBuilder is initialized to store the generated password.
